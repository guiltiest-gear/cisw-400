    <h1>Reverse PIG</h1>
    <p>
      There are two players, and both start with 30 points. The player who's
      turn it is makes a wager of points, ranging from 2 to 12, and rolls the
      dice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on the value of the dice and your wager, the following will
      occur according to these rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If your wager is <i>less</i> than the roll, you lose the wagered points.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your wager is <i>greater</i> than the roll, your opponent loses the
        wagered points.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your wager is <i>exactly</i> the value of the roll, you gain the
        wagered points.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note: To keep a fair balance, if you roll exactly, your turn must be
      passed to the next player.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a special case with snake eyes (being two ones), as your points
      will be reset to 30.
    </p>
    <p>The first person to 0 points or lower loses.</p>
